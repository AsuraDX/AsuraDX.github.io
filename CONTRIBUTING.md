# Contributing to Asura's portfolio
Since it's [Asura](https://GitHub.com/AsuraDX)'s portfolio, [SweetBoy](https://GitHub.com/SweetBoy13735) will be doing the heavy-lifting. However, the project is open to small contributions. These are:
- Issue submissions (Bug reports, feature requests, etc...)
- Hot-fixes

## Submitting an issue
If you notice a bug or you have an idea for a new feature, the best way you can communicate it to us is by submitting an issue.

### If you've spotted a bug:
1. Title your issue with the prefix of "**BUG REPORT:** ", following with the bug at hand.
2. Dive into further detail with a full description of what the bug is. Please try to include links to images or any console outputs if possible. If you can consistently replicate the bug, document the steps you took so it can be tracked down.

### If you want to request a feature:
1. Title your issue with the prefix of "**FEATURE REQUEST:** ", following with the feature at hand.
2. Dive into further detail with a full description of what you'd like to see. Feel free to include images that help convey the idea.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Not all features will fit Asura's preferences. If your feature is rejected, this is most likely the reason; a comment will be posted explaining why.

## Writing a hot-fix
If you'd like to take on a bug that hasn't been responded to, here's what you'll need to do:

1. Leave a comment on the relating issue expressing your interest.
2. Once it's acknowledged and it's OK for you to take it on, fork the repository and commit your fixes to a hot-fix branch.
3. When your changes have been made, create a pull request into the origin's default branch and title your request as "**HOT-FIX:** ", leading on with the bug you're tackling. Add SweetBoy13735 as a reviewer of the changes.
4. He'll have a look and review the request. If it's approved, the hot-fix will be merged. If the request still requires more changes, please take a look and amend your changes as needed. Once this is done, re-request the review.
